How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Need to read less, focus more

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Not fix the same error many times, learn from past mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Allows more experimenting, and more focus on when to commit, make sure with one last review

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for software developers, g-docs is general purpose

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commit descriptions and git diff spits out the details

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know how to backtrack easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

not sure if I need this customization, but I still need git for version control
